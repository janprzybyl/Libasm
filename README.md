# Libasm
The aim of this project is to get familiar with assembly language.

# The language
An assembly language is a low-level programming language designed for a specific type of processor. As we mentioned before the language differs depending of your processor’s architecture. In the this project, I will focus on the Intel x86–64 syntax.<br />The assembly language describes the succession of commands your processor will execute. One line means one instruction. To better understand this project I highly recommend this article -> [a link](https://medium.com/a-42-journey/a-quick-guide-to-code-your-first-assembly-functions-43c2032ebfda)

# General
The project contains basic functions in Assembly using the x86 Intel syntax.
